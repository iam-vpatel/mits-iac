To **automate creation of a Route53 alias entry with EC2 hostname as FQDN** after spinning up the EC2 instance from a Terraform module, here's a clean, modular, and reusable approach:

---

### ✅ Option 1: **Same EC2 module handles Route53 entry**

Good for small or tightly-coupled modules.

#### Steps:

1. In your EC2 module output the EC2's public/private IP or hostname.
2. In the same module (or inside a nested `aws_route53_record` block):

   ```hcl
   resource "aws_route53_record" "hostname_record" {
     zone_id = var.zone_id
     name    = "${var.hostname}.${var.domain_name}" # e.g., "web01.dev.example.com"
     type    = "A"
     ttl     = 300
     records = [aws_instance.ec2.private_ip] # or public_ip depending on need
   }
   ```

---

### ✅ Option 2: **Separate reusable `route53` module**

Better for **multi-use**, cross-component automation, and large infra.

#### Module structure:

- `modules/route53_record/main.tf`:

  ```hcl
  resource "aws_route53_record" "fqdn" {
    zone_id = var.zone_id
    name    = var.record_name # full hostname
    type    = "A"
    ttl     = 300
    records = [var.target_ip]
  }
  ```

- `variables.tf`:

  ```hcl
  variable "zone_id" {}
  variable "record_name" {}
  variable "target_ip" {}
  ```

#### Call it after EC2 module:

```hcl
module "ec2" {
  source = "../modules/ec2"
  ...
}

module "route53" {
  source      = "../modules/route53_record"
  zone_id     = var.route53_zone_id
  record_name = "${var.hostname}.${var.domain_name}" # e.g. web01.dev.example.com
  target_ip   = module.ec2.private_ip
}
```

---

### 🔁 Automate & Idempotency

- Terraform is declarative — so if the EC2 IP or hostname changes, the `aws_route53_record` will be updated automatically.
- If you spin up **multiple EC2s**, loop over them with `for_each` or `count`, and apply same logic to create Route53 entries dynamically.

#### Example:

```hcl
resource "aws_route53_record" "ec2_records" {
  for_each = aws_instance.ec2_instances

  zone_id = var.zone_id
  name    = "${each.value.tags["Name"]}.${var.domain_name}"
  type    = "A"
  ttl     = 300
  records = [each.value.private_ip]
}
```

---

### ✅ Summary

| Approach                   | Use Case                                           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Same EC2 module            | Simple infra, tightly coupled logic                |
| Separate Route53 module    | Large projects, reusability, separation of concern |
| Loop-based dynamic records | Multi-VM environments                              |
